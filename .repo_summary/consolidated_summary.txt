of your project "Linux Ram Cleaner" in the specified format:


1. **Project Name:** Linux Ram Cleaner
2. **Short Description:** A bash script to clean and reclaim RAM on Linux systems.
3. **Overall Description:** The Linux Ram Cleaner project aims to create a simple yet effective way to free up RAM on Linux-based systems by executing various commands that clear system caches, dentries, inodes, and swap memory. This is achieved through the use of the `free -h` command to display current memory usage before and after cleanup, along with other utility scripts for cleaning specific cache types.

4. **Main Purpose:** The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to reclaim RAM on Linux systems using various methods.
5. **Key Technologies:**
   - Bash scripting
   - Linux system commands (`free`, `sync`, `echo`)
6. **Unique Features:**
   - Customizable cleanup scripts for specific cache types
   - Integration with existing Linux system commands
7. **Future Improvements:**
   - Implementing a GUI interface for easier user interaction
   - Adding support for more advanced RAM management techniques
8. **Personal Notes:** As a developer, I wanted to experiment with creating a simple yet useful tool that showcases the power of Bash scripting on Linux systems.
9. **GitHub Tags:** linux, ram, cleaner, bash, scripting, system administration, cache, dentries, inodes, swap memory, free command, sync command
10. **Installable Modules:** `python-bash`, `linux-commands`
11. **Suggested Folder Names:** Scripts, Cache Cleanup, Linux Tools, System Admin
12. **Root Project Folder Name Suggestions:** Ram Cleaner, Linux Cache Tool, System Reclaimer
